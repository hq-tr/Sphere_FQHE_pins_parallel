# Diagonalization of two- and one-body potentials on the sphere

This routine contains exact diagonalization (ED) routines for a Hamiltonian of the form

$$\hat H = \hat V^{2bdy} + \lambda \hat V^{1bdy}$$

where $\hat V^{2bdy}$ and $\hat V^{1bdy}$ denotes the two- and one-body potentials, respectively.

This is a work in progress. Detailed documentation will be made available soon.

## Known bugs
• The output matrix files are corrupted for 2 electrons. (For 3 electrons or more, it is fine and the results are correct.)
