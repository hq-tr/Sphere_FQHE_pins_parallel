• Updated SphereED_v5.jl to only record matrix elements if it is larger than TOL = 1e-14.
• Now only the upper-triangular terms of the one-body matrix is recorded
	• The two-body matrix is still recorded in full for now. This matrix is typically smaller and is not the bottle neck.

• Updated SphereED_v5.jl to combine repeated lines in output with the same (row,col) index pairs.
	- It only applies to each subzone. So potentially there could still be repeated index pairs if they occur in different subzones. This problem is not addressed yet (check To-do)
